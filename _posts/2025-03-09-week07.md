But on the bright side, you ARE in luck because you’ve discovered this post and can attend the event! 🤗🤗🤗

## I think we are stiking with Mattermost

So far, I am very pleased with the dynamics of my team: we all are quite picky when it comes to choosing a projet and yet not picky to the extent of a complete loss of touch with one another. We are strongly considering Mattermost at this point, since:
+ It supports programming languages that interest us.

+ Lots of diverse issues to work on. 

+ It’s a larger project compared to Music Blocks, offering more challenges.

+ The contributor community is great, and responses are quick.

+ There is abundant documentation for contributors, and many issues are “up for grabs” – meaning if you claim one, it’s yours!

+ As contributors, we don’t need to host Mattermost on our own external servers; we can simply test it locally—a huge A+. 

+ There are plenty of memes about Mattermost’s occasional finicky nature, which suggests there’s ample room for improvement. 

## Yeah but what about...

Now, some issues and concerns to keep in mind are: 
+ **Future Open Source Status:** How long will Mattermost remain open source? I recently stumbled upon a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattermost/comments/1fjnykj/is_v10_the_practical_end_of_free_and_open_source/?rdt=45878) suggesting that with each new version, Mattermost appears to be shifting away from open source and leaning towards closed-source ideologies—a definite concern for us.
+ **Licensing Issues:** While evaluating the project, I noticed that Mattermost [doesn’t use a single, unified license](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). In addition to MIT, GNU, and Apache, they also offer a commercial license, which leaves us with some unanswered questions.
+ **Dependency Management:** If we do stick with Mattermost, we need to ensure we have the correct versions of Go, Node.js, and any required libraries (like libpng). This can be challenging—especially on macOS and ARM-based machines, which, as far as I know, all three of us are using.

## Is there hope? 

Of course there is: 
+ I started a discussion post for Professor Klukowska about the licensing issue to make sure we’re on the safe side.
+ All three of us have decided to complete the [developer setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/developer-setup/) by this Thursday. We’ll attempt to fix [this issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/25993) locally and then discuss how manageable it was, epsecially since this is an “easy” difficulty issue.
