**History of Open Source**

It still strikes me how open source grew out of a simple desire of people wanting to share knowledge and improve technology without artificial barriers! Something that definitely stickd out to me was how by the 1990s, open source went mainstream through projects like **Linux**, **Apache**, and **MySQL**, all of which thrived on global collaboration, and how [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/solutions?sc_cid=RHCTN0250000435836&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADsbVMRUNLo5fut9-xMyrDB2xX0C4&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyIqTnLGRjAMVJEpHAR23IxjhEAAYASAAEgLKnfD_BwE), for example, demonstrated that companies could profit by providing services and support around open-source software.

**Faces of Open Source**

It was interesting to learn about such concept as *hacker ethic*-that knowledge is meant to be shared, explored, and improved. Projects such as [Faces of Open Source](https://www.facesofopensource.com) are extrenely cool, as they are the final milestone of open source's transparent morals and beliefs. It reminds us that the passion and collaboration behind open source come from **real** people.

**Open Source AI Definition**

I guess what striked me the most in this talk is the fact that the [four main freedoms from the GNU philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) still serve as the only baseline for creation of new policies and potentially licenses for AI-based open source initiatives, and nothing else. Given how opaque and unpredictable deep learning models can be, I expected to hear about new pitfalls or responsibilities introduced by AI’s “black box” nature—especially since developers often cannot fully control or foresee their models’ outcomes. This mismatch between expectation and reality raises intriguing questions about whether just traditional open source principles remain adequate for projects that rely on complex, data-driven algorithms.

It was interesting to learn about the complexity of making training and validation data freely available to the public, as fifferent data types come with diverse legal, ethical, and logistical hurdles.
