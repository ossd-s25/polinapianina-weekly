Stella, Chuqiao, and I are working together on creating an extension for FireFox. We have made a lot of progress since Monday, even though it might not necessarilly feel that way, which, I believe, is something that often happens with any kind of work that poeple do - they tend not to appreciate how far they've come 🪷

We agreed on idea/concept for our extension pretty quickly, surprisingly quickly 🚀, and kept adding little features to it as we became more involved in the development process.

I truly appreciate the approach we chose: creating user storiesand acceptance criteria first, and only then dividing tasks into subsections for easier distribution among us 🤝🤝🤝

The biggest challenge we've faced so far has been task distribution, I think. In general, it can be very difficult to divide work equally among all group members. But we are getting there 🎯. We decided to comment on each task that we are willing to work on and proceed from there, which seems to be working for us 💪. Of course, things might get chaotic tomorrow and on Tuesday as we try to wrap things up 🤯 🚧

On the bright side, all of my team memebrs are very responsive and willing to communicate. No one disappears for hours on read, and everyone is excited to create a fun little silly extension 🤜🤛

So far, I feel like we've all contributed equally: I wrote the user stories and designed the pet models that will be used in the extension, while the rest shared their comments. Stella set up the task structure for us, and Chuqiao created the project repository and added some initial files 🧩

I wouldn’t say I’ve discovered anything surprising about myself during this process. Although I must say that this semester is actually the first time I’ve had group projects as part of a course curriculum (I know, it’s insane whenever I tell people that! Maybe that should have been my unusual fact in the first class). While I was both excited and a little nervous about how it would go, I wasn’t unfamiliar with group projects in general, so I knew what to expect from both the process and myself 🔥🔥🔥
