## Git

_Local dot-git stores_<br>
_Confusion lurks in merges_ <br> 
_Use single quotes now_

<!--more-->

The most surprising thing to see was **being able to work entirely on the local machine without ever needing a remote repository** and hence storing everything directly in the .git folder on the device. It was **eye-opening** üëÄ The most challenging parts, in my opinion, are commands for managing merges, where even a small typo could cause confusion. I am also very **happy to finally learn how to include exclamation points in commit messages by using single quotes**! 

I also appreciated the joke _"Commit early, commit often. A tip for version controlling - not for relationships."_ While it's true, <ins>one should not commit every single new line of code</ins> as one will get lost in the commits forest to lose their purpose...

## Other Teams' Extensions

_Open source marvels_<br>
_Team Five‚Äôs Quick Notes spark wonders_<br>
_Eager now to help_

In one word ‚Äî **truly inspiring**! I loved how different each extension was and hence how each team‚Äôs extension once again proved just **how diverse and creative open source projects can be**!

One special standout for me was **Team 5‚Äôs Quick Notes extension**. It is simply brimming with smart features: seamless Markdown, LaTeX support, the ability to resize the note-taking window and toggle between source and preview modes. The deployment instructions are laid out with clarity, have copy-friendly commands, images, and links, and there‚Äôs even a detailed guide on specialized and generic LaTeX environments!!!

I also love how they‚Äôve structured their documentation: **the presence of a separate presentation file is a new discovery for me**, and something I‚Äôll keep in mind for my future projects. I also think that **the ‚ÄúContributors‚Äù section being at the end is a nice professional touch**, reminiscent of non-student open source repositories, for students tend to state their names first before stating anything, as a matter of habit. They sure set the bar high!

**I am eager to contribute to one of these projects and add it to my contibutions page!**

## Reflection on our work

_Deep breaths, steady mind,_<br>
_We forgot introductions,_<br>
_We remain calm still._<br>


One biggest takeaway: **always introduce ourselves** (which we forgot!) **and stay calm if anything goes wrong.**
