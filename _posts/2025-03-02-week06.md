## How are THINGS? 

A lot are still in limbo state. On February 15th, I started writing a Wiki article on [Taisia Kitayskaya](https://www.taisiakitaiskaia.com) and I'm still figuring it out. I hope to finish this contribution by the end of the upcoming week!

**Challenges in Writing a Wiki Article:**  
- **Information Overload:** Researching and verifying accurate sources is overwhelming, even as a senior with a baggage of experience in researching.  
- **Maintaining Neutrality:** It's surprisingly challenging to present information in an unbiased manner while still being engaging.  
- **Content Organization:** Structuring the article is THE daunting part of it but I am getting there.
- **Consistency:** Adhering to Wiki guidelines and keeping formatting consistent across sections can be tricky.

This *phantom* Wiki article has been one of my biggest personal contributions so far, which now I realize was not the bestest idea, as it sort of blocked me from working on other contributions.

## How ARE things?

I am quite anxious about finishing the article, and while I’m confident it will eventually be approved (since I’m not directly related to the subject and have pedantically cited every fact), I do realize that my contributions productivity haven't been matching my potential so far. I was very productive in my head, as I constantly had ideas for new contributions and fortunately wrote them all down, so things should go uphill from here.

I’m particularly proud of my contribution to the [GitHelper](https://github.com/danny031103/OSSD_group_Extension) project. After the team’s presentation, I immediately thought of enhancing their extension by adding a copy feature and hover tooltips for command explanations. Hopefully, they will accept my PR.


## HOW are things? 
I have plenty of ideas for future contributions. Here’s a quick checklist of upcoming ones:

- Finish the Wiki article on Taisia Kitayskaya
- Help my peers fix image display issues on their weekly blogs (as I recently discovered a solution)
- Work on translation contributions for Cryptomator
- Contribute documentation improvements for Music Blocks from Sugar Labs

I’m glad that I constantly have new ideas, now I just need to act on them more often! Things should start looking up next week, especially with my Honors Thesis deadline approaching (help me) and hence allwoing me to focus on other apsects of my life very soon.
