## Mattermost is what Matters Most

My team and I did not work on the project during spring break at all, so we started off by assigning some long-term issues to each other. This was also when we began exploring other Mattermost repos, such as **mattermost-mobile**, **desktop**, **docs**, and **mattermost-developer-documentation**. That being said, we began getting ourselves acquainted with each repo, their issues, contributing rules (which differ for each), and, most importantly, developer setups for each environment. We are currently all working on our own assigned issues and a bunch of smaller tasks!

## What we hope to achieve in the future

If I’m being very realistic, I think it would be great if each of us (and there are three of us) could make at least two big contributions (like implementing a new feature or fixing a noticeable bug within the system), plus many smaller contributions (at least 10 each!) that might include:

- Translation contributions
- Documentation contributions
- Testing the mobile app

I believe that’s a solid plan, and I hope my teammates will be just as ambitious as I am—if not more so.

## Shivam’s Presentation

One thing I have to say right away: I wish this presentation had happened way earlier in the semester! The amount of resources shared with us would have been so useful for:

- Searching for the perfect final project
- Applying for grants and fellowships!!! (unfortunately, by the time Shivam shared these great resources with us, many were already closed for this semester)

I was still able to apply to [Igalia Coding Experience](https://www.igalia.com/coding-experience/), so I truly appreciate Shivam’s presentation!

I also appreciated Shivam sharing his personal experience with open source; it was very motivating to see how many unexpected doors open source opened for him.
